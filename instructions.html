  <p>1. After you press any key, you will be directed to level 1 and one of the four buttons which appear on the screen will blink in random.</p>
  <p>2. You should press the button which was blinked and  if you fail to do so, your game is over and you have to restart your game.</p>
  <p>3. When you press the correct button, you will be directed to next level in which another random button blinks. </p>
  <p>4. Now you should press the button which was blinked in current level followed by the button blinked in previous level</p>
  <p>5. Then in next level, you will have to press the buttons of level 1, 2 and 3 one after the other.</p>
  <p>6.  This forms a sequence of buttons which you have to memorize on your own and press the buttons in correct sequence in every level of the game.</p>
  <p>7. Failing to do so in any level of the game will lead to erroneous input and you will have to play the game from the start.</p>
